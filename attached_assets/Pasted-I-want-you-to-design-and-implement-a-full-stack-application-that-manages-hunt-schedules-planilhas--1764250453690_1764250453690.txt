I want you to design and implement a full-stack application that manages hunt schedules (“planilhas de hunt”) for multiple Tibia servers. The system will have two types of users: admins and regular users. Follow the requirements below and implement the backend, frontend, and database structure accordingly.

Core Requirements
1. Server and Respawn Management (Admin Only)

An admin can manage one or multiple Tibia servers.

Each server must allow:

Registering and editing respawns.

Registering and editing time slots for each respawn.

Admins should be able to update, delete, and review all entries they have permission for.

2. User Hunt Requests

A user can submit a hunt request to a server they play on.

A request must contain:

Up to three preferred time slot options.

The desired respawn/hunt area.

The user’s party (PT) composition: list of character names and roles.

Requests must go into a queue.

3. Admin Review of Requests

Admins must be able to:

View all pending requests.

Approve or reject each request.

Provide comments when rejecting.

When accepting one request all the other with the same slot and hunt should appear to show the other PT and if it's accepted these ones should be rejected with a message saying that it's rejected because of this one.

The request list must be sorted by priority, following a priority rule configurable in code (e.g., score, request time, previous approvals, etc.).

4. Scoring System

Each PT member gains points for participating in hunts or helping the team.

Points must be:

Auditable (every score change must have a justification log).

Linked to a specific user account.

User's can provide print screens to add points and this should be accepted by the admin.

Admins must be able to:

Add points.

Remove points.

View history logs.

5. Additional Features

Authentication system token-based.

Role-based permissions.

Dashboard for admins and players.

Responsive UI.

Technical Requirements

Backend: Python (FastAPI)

Frontend: React, Next.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Include:

Complete database schema.

GraphQL API.

Example endpoints.

Data validation.

Error handling.

Authorization middleware.

Simple UI mockups or component structure.

Deliverables

Provide:

A full project architecture.

Database schema (tables/collections, fields, and relationships).

API definitions (routes, payloads, examples).

Core backend logic.

Suggested frontend structure and components.

Example admin and user flows.

Anything else needed to make the app functional end-to-end.
